Containers are an abstraction at the application layer that package code and its dependencies together.
Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the host operating system's kernel, while remaining isolated from each other in user space.
Containers are lightweight — typically tens or hundreds of megabytes — which makes them fast to start, resource-efficient, and ideal for running microservices.

Virtual Machines are an abstraction of physical hardware.
A hypervisor allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine.
Each VM includes:

its own full OS

the application

all the binaries and libraries required to run that app
This makes them heavy (often tens of gigabytes) and slower to boot than containers.

Before Docker (and before microservices became the norm), most applications were built as monoliths — big, tightly-coupled systems. In that setup:

(1) All features (login, comments, payments, database) are in one big codebase.

(2) They often share the same runtime, memory, and process space.

(3) So if the comment system crashes, it could bring down the entire site.

Example:

A fatal error in the email module = entire server restarts = downtime across the board.


Before Docker, a common problem developers faced was the "It works on my machine" issue.

𝙀𝙭𝙖𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙚:
A developer writes code and it runs perfectly on their machine.

A tester tries to run the same code, but it fails.

Why? Maybe:

Missing dependencies

Different OS versions

Environment variables not configured

Conflicting software versions

Docker solves this problem by allowing developers to package the app along with everything it needs — dependencies, environment variables, binaries — into a Docker image.

This image can be run anywhere: on another developer’s machine, in a test environment, or in production — and it will always behave the same.

Good question! VMs can solve the same problem, but:

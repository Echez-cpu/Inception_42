Containers are an abstraction at the application layer that package code and its dependencies together.
Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the host operating system's kernel, while remaining isolated from each other in user space.
Containers are lightweight — typically tens or hundreds of megabytes — which makes them fast to start, resource-efficient, and ideal for running microservices.

Virtual Machines are an abstraction of physical hardware.
A hypervisor allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine.
Each VM includes:

its own full OS

the application

all the binaries and libraries required to run that app
This makes them heavy (often tens of gigabytes) and slower to boot than containers.

Before Docker, a common problem developers faced was the "It works on my machine" issue.

Example:
A developer writes code and it runs perfectly on their machine.

A tester tries to run the same code, but it fails.

Why? Maybe:

Missing dependencies

Different OS versions

Environment variables not configured

Conflicting software versions

Docker solves this problem by allowing developers to package the app along with everything it needs — dependencies, environment variables, binaries — into a Docker image.

This image can be run anywhere: on another developer’s machine, in a test environment, or in production — and it will always behave the same.

Good question! VMs can solve the same problem, but:

Aspect	Virtual Machines	Docker Containers
Size	GBs	MBs
Boot time	Minutes	Seconds
Performance	Slower (entire OS)	Faster (uses host kernel)
Efficiency	Less efficient (1 VM = 1 OS)	Very efficient (shared kernel)
Portability	Limited	Very portable
